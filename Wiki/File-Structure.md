## File Structure

File structure was one of the many subjects we started discussing at the beginning stage of assignment 3.
It has gone through several iterations before we settle on the file structure we have right now.

Initially, we have a GameData folder to store all game generated information. But then we realized that a better solution is to create three sub folders (game,practice and setting) to store different data for different game modules. 

### Bash Script
The method we used to create the file structure is to run a script file that create the directory tree and the corresponding file in each sub folder.

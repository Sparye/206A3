## Main Menu GUI

The design for the Main Menu was originally copied from one of our Assignment 2 versions.

We chose pink as our background colour. We were very happy to hear from Nasser in a later client meeting that his colour of choice would also have been pink.
We initially made all the menu buttons light blue, to contrast with the pink.

We soon realised this did not help the user to build an association between specific colours and functions. We developed a "traffic light" colour scheme involving green, orange, and red:

- Green buttons would allow the user to proceed.
- Yellow buttons allowed the user to return to saved questions.
- Red buttons would return the user to the previous menu.
- Black was assigned to the reset button, that would erase all user progress.

Traffic lights are common throughout New Zealand, and are known to people of all ages. The colours are also easily distinguished from our pink background.

## Score

Score is the number of points the user gained from playing the game module of the program.

In order to save the user's score after the user has closed the program. We decided to have a text file to save the user score. 

In java,we created a dedicated class to store methods that deals with the score system. We have a method that not only read from the score file and also writes to it. That means we have one function that does two things.

The name of the method was controversial as one of us used it in assignment 2. After a long discuss, we decided to change the name of the method to fit under the context of assignment 3.
